## Project setup

- [ ] `project.config.md` created from `PROJECT_CONFIG_TEMPLATE.md`
- [ ] Project workspace layout follows `templates/project-workspace.sample.md`
- [ ] `automation/question-banks/` exists

- [ ] `wayground/` or the target quiz entry page folder exists
- [ ] Playwright installed

## Browser setup

- [ ] Chrome is opened with remote debugging on port `9222`, or `CDP_URL` is set to the active CDP endpoint
- [ ] User is already logged into Wayground in that Chrome profile
- [ ] User is already logged into Gemini if Gemini review will be used
- [ ] `npm.cmd run browser:smoke` succeeds
- [ ] `npm.cmd run wayground:inspect` succeeds when the logged-in browser is ready
- [ ] If using a non-default CDP port, commands are run with `CDP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:<port>`

## Textbook to bank trial

- [ ] A small textbook excerpt is placed in `docs/references/textbooks/`
- [ ] Curriculum / competency indicators, teaching goals, and question scope have been organized according to `PREP_BEFORE_QUESTION_BANK_SOP.md`
- [ ] A 5 to 10 question sample bank is generated in `automation/question-banks/sample.md`
- [ ] Local validation is completed
- [ ] `docs/workflow/DISTRACTOR_SELF_REVIEW.md` is applied to apply/analyze/evaluate and high-risk questions
- [ ] Gemini second review is completed when required
- [ ] Any review findings are resolved in the local bank

## Wayground trial

- [ ] `npm.cmd run wayground:import -- .\automation\question-banks\sample.md --subject <subject> --lang Chinese --grade <grade>` succeeds
- [ ] `npm.cmd run wayground:check -- .\automation\question-banks\sample.md` succeeds
- [ ] `npm.cmd run wayground:set-all-timers-2min` succeeds
- [ ] `npm.cmd run wayground:publish` succeeds
- [ ] Quiz link is recorded
- [ ] Target quiz entry page is updated

## Portability check

- [ ] No source-project absolute paths remain in copied workflow docs
- [ ] No old grade, school, or exam-scope assumptions remain unless intentionally configured
- [ ] All final report paths are target-project paths
